Oracle Solaris 11 Hands-on Labs
===============================

In this labs we introduce the most interesting features of Oracle Solaris 11,
based on real life use cases. We will:

-   create a disk pool and a file system with ZFS; expand it; snapshot and
    clone it; use ZFS compression and deduplication; use ZFS migration for
    backup 
-   create a new boot environment as a backup, make our current system
    unbootable because of some fatal mistakes, reboot the system using
    backup BE 
-   use new packaging system called IPS to search, install, verify and
    fix packages; update the system using IPS and Boot Environments
    together
-   use new networking commands, configure virtual network interfaces
-   create a couple of Solaris virtual environments (zones); install some
    applications into them; clone a zone; use Resource Management with the zones:
-   learn how to install systems and zones with Automated Installer
-   compare two virtualization options available in Oracle Solaris: non-global
    zones and kernel zones
