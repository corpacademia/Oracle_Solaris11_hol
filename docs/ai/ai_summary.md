We have completed this Automated Installer Hands-on Lab. Let's wrap up
what we did today:

-   We installed our AI client system *seven times* (at least)!
-   We learned how to perform simple default installations
-   We learned how to define which Solaris version will be installed on
    which clients
-   We configured packages to be installed in addition to the standard
    group
-   We used profiles and profile templates to configure system's
    identity including hostnames, IP addresses and users
-   We used Unified Archives to clone systems and found out that in most
    times it's a faster and more convenient way to install systems
-   We automatically installed zones inside the client system

There are other AI features that we didn't cover in this lab. You may
want to add some other capabilities to your AI server, such as: first
boot script, x86 architecture service, derived manifests and others. You
may want to try AI Manifest Wizard that helps you to create XML
manifests using web interface. Also it might be a good idea to configure
a special role for AI administration (using Solaris Role-Based Access
Control) to avoid using `root` role for this task.
