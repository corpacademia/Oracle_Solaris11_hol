Before starting this lab make sure that you either:

1.  have access to the external Oracle package repository (the output of
    `pkg list -a | wc -l` should give your more than 3500 packages), **or**
2.  have completed the [Repository Installation](../ips/ips_repo.md) exercise from IPS Lab and installed a small local repository
